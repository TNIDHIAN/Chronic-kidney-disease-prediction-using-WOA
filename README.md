# Chronic kidney disease prediction using WOA
Developing a system for Chronic kidney disease prediction using WOA.
About:

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) prediction is a critical task in healthcare as it allows for early diagnosis and intervention, potentially preventing the progression of the disease and improving patient outcomes. Traditional methods for CKD prediction often involve statistical techniques or machine learning algorithms. One such algorithm that can be employed for this purpose is the Whale Optimization Algorithm (WOA).
