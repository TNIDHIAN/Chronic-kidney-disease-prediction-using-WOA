# Chronic kidney disease prediction using WOA
Developing a system for Chronic kidney disease prediction using WOA.
About:

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) prediction is a critical task in healthcare as it allows for early diagnosis and intervention, potentially preventing the progression of the disease and improving patient outcomes. Traditional methods for CKD prediction often involve statistical techniques or machine learning algorithms. One such algorithm that can be employed for this purpose is the Whale Optimization Algorithm (WOA).

Features Used:

Detection Accuracy: 96.7%
Note: These metrics can be customized based on your actual performance evaluations.


## Results and Impact
<!--Give the results and impact as shown below-->
WOA improves the performance of all classifiers based on 
this analysis. LRC accuracy is fine-tuned from 88.1% to 
92.5% due to WOA, while DTC accuracy is finetuned from 
90.1% to 92.85%. RFC performance has increased from 95.0 
to 98.80%. As a result, the proposed RFC+ WOA is chosen 
for final CKD prediction.
